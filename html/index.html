        <h2>Hello, Nice to see you here.</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Science Engineer. I am studying Full Stack Software
            development in Lambton College Toronto. I love coffee and travelling
            with my friends. I have come to Canada with lots of dreams and
            aspirations to become successful in life. I have played Under 19 cricket
            back home. Wanted to be a cricketer but god has different plans for me.
            Life here is awesome and I'm thankful for everything.

                <p>
                    I started learning to code when I was 18 years old. I wanted to
                    develop my own video games. Over time, I have lots of knowledge in
                    developing web and mobile applications.

                <h3>Hot Wings Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    My best skill is in eating hot wings. I can accept any challenge for
                    eating wings.
